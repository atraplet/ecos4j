# Note

The repository of the underlying solver ECOS is inactive. Moreover, ECOS has known issues with performance and numerical stability. 
Hence, we decided to stop the development of ecos4j and to archive it.

If you are interested in solving convex optimization problems with Java, then you may use our project [clarabel4j](https://github.com/atraplet/clarabel4j).
The underlying native solver Clarabel improves the algorithm and implementation of ECOS and is under active development.

*This library requires JDK 23 as it depends on
Java's [Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html).*

ecos4j (ECOS Solver for Java) is a Java library that provides an interface from the Java programming language to the
native open source mathematical programming solver [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos). It invokes the solver
through
Java's [Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html).

## Usage

### Dependency

Add the latest version from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.ustermetrics/ecos4j) to
your `pom.xml`

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ustermetrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>ecos4j</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### Native Library

Either add the latest version of [ecos4j-native](https://github.com/atraplet/ecos4j-native)
from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.ustermetrics/ecos4j-native) to
your `pom.xml`

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ustermetrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>ecos4j-native</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

or install the native solver on the machine and add the location to the `java.library.path`. ecos4j dynamically loads
the native solver.

### Run Code

Since ecos4j invokes some restricted methods of the FFM API, use `--enable-native-access=com.ustermetrics.ecos4j`
or `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` (if you are not using the Java Platform Module System) to avoid warnings from
the Java runtime.

## Build

### Java bindings

The directory `./bindings` contains the files and scripts needed to generate the Java bindings. The actual bindings are
under `./src/main/java` in the package `com.ustermetrics.ecos4j.bindings`.

The scripts depend on the [jextract](https://jdk.java.net/jextract/) tool, which mechanically generates Java bindings
from native library headers.

The bindings are generated in two steps: First, `./bindings/generate_includes.sh` generates the dumps of the included
symbols in the `includes.txt` file. Replace absolute platform dependent path with relative platform independent path in
the comments. Remove unused includes. Second, `./bindings/generate_bindings.sh` generates the actual Java bindings.
Add `NativeLoader.loadLibrary.` Remove platform dependent layout constants and make the code platform independent.

## Release

Update the version in the `pom.xml`, create a tag, and push it by running

```
export VERSION=X.Y.Z
git checkout --detach HEAD
sed -i -E "s/<version>[0-9]+\-SNAPSHOT<\/version>/<version>$VERSION<\/version>/g" pom.xml
git commit -m "v$VERSION" pom.xml
git tag v$VERSION
git push origin v$VERSION
```

This will trigger the upload of the package to Maven Central via GitHub Actions.

Then, go to the GitHub repository [releases page](https://github.com/atraplet/ecos4j/releases) and update the release.
